Predict The News Category Hackathon" is a machine learning project that aims to classify news articles into different categories using various models such as Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Ensemble learning. The project involves the preprocessing of text data, feature extraction, and building a robust classification model that can accurately predict the category of news articles.

The Logistic Regression model will be used to create a linear model that can predict the probability of a news article belonging to a specific category. Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes models are suitable for text classification tasks and will be used to model the conditional probabilities of each word in the article given the news category. Support Vector Machines are a powerful tool for classification tasks with non-linear boundaries, and will be used to classify news articles based on a set of features extracted from the text. Finally, Ensemble learning techniques such as Bagging and Boosting will be used to combine the results of multiple models and improve the overall accuracy of the classification model.

Overall, the project will provide insights into text classification tasks using a variety of models and techniques, and help to identify the most effective methods for predicting the category of news articles.
